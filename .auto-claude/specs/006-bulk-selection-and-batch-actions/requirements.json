  "task_description": "# Bulk Selection and Batch Actions\n\nAllow users to select multiple torrents and perform actions on all selected items at once. Support pause, resume, delete, and category assignment for selected torrents.\n\n## Rationale\nPower users managing large libraries need to perform operations on multiple torrents efficiently. Individual torrent actions are too slow for managing dozens of torrents. VueTorrent users report UI freezing during bulk ops (pain-2-5), so we should optimize this.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a power user, I want to select multiple completed torrents so that I can delete them all at once\n- As a user, I want to pause all downloading torrents so that I can prioritize bandwidth for other activities\n- As a user, I want to assign a category to multiple torrents so that I can organize my library quickly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can select individual torrents via checkbox\n- [ ] A 'select all' option selects all visible/filtered torrents\n- [ ] Selected count is displayed in the UI\n- [ ] Batch actions (pause, resume, delete) are available when torrents are selected\n- [ ] Bulk operations are performed asynchronously without freezing the UI\n- [ ] Category can be assigned to multiple torrents at once\n- [ ] Selection is cleared after batch action completes\n",
