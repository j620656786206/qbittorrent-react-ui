  "task_description": "Enable users to add new torrents to qBittorrent through the web UI. Support both magnet link input (paste or click magnet links) and .torrent file upload. Include options for save path, category assignment, and start/pause state.\n\nRationale\nThis is the most critical missing feature. Without the ability to add torrents, users must switch to another interface, defeating the purpose of a complete WebUI. This addresses the known gap and is essential for daily-driver usage.\n\nUser Stories\n\"As a power user, I want to add magnet links directly from the web UI so that I don't need to open another interface\"\n\"As a mobile user, I want to paste magnet links I copied from websites so that I can add torrents on the go\"\n\"As a user, I want to upload .torrent files so that I can add torrents from private trackers\"\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nUsers can paste a magnet link into an input field and add it to qBittorrent\nUsers can upload a .torrent file from their device\nUsers can optionally specify a save path before adding\nUsers can assign a category when adding a torrent\nUsers can choose to start paused or start immediately\nThe new torrent appears in the list immediately after adding\nMobile users can easily tap to add magnet links from other apps",
